   The Muen system policy is a description of a component-based system running
   on top of the Muen Separation Kernel. It defines what hardware resources are
   present, how many active components (called subjects) the system is composed
   of, how they interact and which system resources they are allowed to access.

   The following section will give a short introduction to the contents of the
   Muen policy with links to detailed information, and also the different policy
   formats in use.

   After that, the build process is explained. Section \ref{schema} then
   specifies the XML-schema format of the Muen system policy.

    The following properties are specified by the policy:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration values
    \item Hardware resources
    \item Platform description
    \item Kernel diagnostics device
    \item Physical memory regions
    \item Device domains
    \item Events
    \item Communication channels
    \item Components
    \item Subjects
    \item Scheduling plans
    \end{itemize}

    The policy serves as a static description of a Muen system. Since all
    aspects of the system are fixed at integration time the policy is very well
    suited for automated and manual validation prior to system execution.

    For more information about the different properties, see the XML-schema
    documentation in section \ref{schema}.

    The system policy is specified in XML. There are currently three different
    policy formats:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Source Format
    \item Format A
    \item Format B
    \end{itemize}

    The motivation to have several policy formats is to provide abstractions and a
    compact way for users to specify a system while simultaneously facilitate
    reduced complexity of tools operating on the policy.

    The implementation of such tools is simplified by the absence of
    higher-level abstractions which would make the extraction of input data more
    involved. As an example, the tool responsible for page table generation can
    directly access all virtual memory mappings of a subject and must not
    concern itself with channels. The channel abstraction has already been
    broken down into the corresponding memory elements during the policy
    compilation step of the build process.

    The following sections give more detail about a specfic format.

    \begin{warning}
    Only the policy in format source is specified in this document, as the other
    formats are considered \emph{for internal use only}. While it is possible to
    specify a system policy in format A or B, it is not recommended.
    \end{warning}

   <section id="intro-policy-format-src" label="Source Format" priority="0">
    <text priority="0">
     The user-specified policy is written in the source format. Constructs such
     as channels or events provide abstractions to simplify the specification of
     component-based systems. Many XML elements and attributes are optional and
     will be filled in with default values during later steps of the policy
     compilation process.

     Kernel and $\tau$0 resources are not part of the source format since they are also
     automatically added by the policy expansion step.

     Additionally the use of configuration values enables easy parametrization of
     the system policy.

     The policy in source format in specified in section \ref{schema}.

   </section>

   <section id="intro-policy-format-a" label="Format A" priority="0">
    <text priority="0">
     Format A is a processed version of the source format where all includes are
     resolved and abstractions such as channels have been broken down into their
     underlying elements. For example, a channel is expanded to a physical
     memory region and the corresponding writer and reader subject mappings with
     the appropriate access rights.

     In this format all implicit elements, such as for example automatically
     generated page table memory regions, are specified. The kernel and $\tau$0
     configuration is also declared as part of format A.

     The only optional attributes are addresses of physical memory regions.

   <section id="intro-policy-format-b" label="Format B" priority="0">
    <text priority="0">
     Format B is equivalent to Format A except that all physical memory regions
     have a fixed location (i.e. their physical address is set).
